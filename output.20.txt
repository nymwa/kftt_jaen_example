it is said that the cause of his death was the cause of his death .
jobutsu is not completed by a certain level of rebir , but even if it was buddha , it is just a practice of practicing buddha ( zen meditation ) , just asking buddha to attain enlightenment .
many kamakura bukkyo ( buddhism of the kamakura period ) established mappo-shiso ( mappoism ) , but in shobogen zuibunki , it is completely impossible to say .
when standing the shozo-matsu ( the end of the statue ) in buddhism , it is a way to stand for a while .
there is only the teachings of shinjitsu .
yorisen and everyone should be carried out .
it is not necessarily the same as that of ariyo 's hills .
there is also a shallow mind and calm on the wonder .
it is for all living things and underneath to give the precepts of buddha and various precepts .
people became a witness of buddhism .
it is said that he did not think it was unavoidable , and he said , ' if i don 't have anything to do so , ' but he just denied the teachings of the disciples of shakyamuni .

umekoji steam locomotive museum is a steam locomotive that is operated by the west japan railway company ( jr west ) in kangiji-cho , shimogyo ward , kyoto city , kyoto prefecture .
on october 10 , 1972 , the japan national railways made a precious transportation facility in umekoji organ , which was located in shimogyo ward , kyoto city for the first time in order to preserve japanese national railways .
with the division and privatization of jnr in 1987 , jr west took over the line .
in addition , this facility itself is a current vehicle base ( umekoji operation section ) , and the jnr / diesel locomotive owned by sagano scenic railway and repaired the facility .
in the first place , this facility was the opportunity to preserve steam locomotives rapidly disappeared from the latter half of 1960s .
at first , koyama locomotive , located in koyama station in tochigi prefecture , was the most important candidate in oyama station , tochigi prefecture , but it was called ' the center of japan ' as its official site .
in principle , the cars for preservation were examined in order to select the number of cars that still exist today , but they were not planned to preserve the model c62 .
the facility consists of the " steam locomotive exhibition museum " utilizing ogigata-kuri and diesel cars in the former umekoji locomotive section , and the old nijo station building was reconstructed and restored .
the ogigata-kuri was made of reinforced concrete constructed in 1914 , and on december 10 , 2004 , it was designated as an important cultural property along with five t-tier ceiling crane ( completed on december 10 , 2004 ) .
it was elected as a civil engineering heritage site in 2004 .
in 2006 , the old nijo station building ( exhibition hall ) and ogigata shako depot , preserved by jr west , were designated as a sub-sprefective railway monuments .
the former nijo station building was built in 1904 , with the oldest wooden structure of the two-story wooden structure in japan , which was constructed by kyoto electric railway as the head office , and was modeled after heian-jingu shrine .
the kyoto electric railway was nationalized in 1907 , and after that , the station was used as national railways , and the main building of the sanin main line ( sagano line ) was rebuilt as the main building in 1996 .
it was designated as a cultural property of kyoto city in april 1996 .
in ogigata-kuri , 16 types of steam locomotives manufactured from the taisho period to the showa period ( at the beginning of the opening of the museum , 17 cars ) are stored and exhibited .
when the museum was opened , it was originally a principle to preserve dynamics , and there were two types of c53 type 45 and c51 model no. 239 cars , which were kept in the same manner as seven-car trains .
among them , five cars are still registered as vehicles , and two cars ( c57 type 1 , c56 type 160 ) are served on the yamaguchi line and the hokuriku main line .
although there are two types of dynamic preservation machines except for these two cars , it is impossible to run on the main line because there is no general inspection .
in addition , the train runs on the track inside the museum with the handling of the dynamic storage machines .
this exhibition line used to be extended to the north of the depot to the north of the current large-scale car parking area ( formerly a rest facility and a park was relocated to the south end of nijo station ) .
even today , the station has functions as an organization district , and is connected with the operating line .
furthermore , after the takatori factory of west japan railway company ( jr west ) was closed , the steam locomotive was also maintained .
plum
the name comes from ' ume ' which means umekoji .
all cars , except for the c62 type no. 1 , designated in 1976 , were designated as sub-express monuments along with the latest car registration code and conservatives .
the procedures that do not have special notes were transferred from the former organization district in 1972 .
since the time of the preservation of umekoji , there was no car registration .

shomyo is a traditional japanese music .
it is a religious music that is used for rites and ceremonies .
in japan , it is also called bonbai or bonno-kuri .
it is written as <unk>明 in the old chinese character style .
it is one of the academic fields of ancient india ( gokyo , gomyo ) .
gomyo refers to five types of study , namely shomyo ( onin-gaku , bunpo-gaku ) , kogenmyo ( kogei , technical theory ) , ihomyo ( ethics ) , and inmyo ( buddhism ) .
it was introduced to japan along with the introduction of buddhism .
in 754 , there is a record that a buddhist memorial service using shomyo was held when the great buddha of todai-ji temple was held , and it is believed that shomyo was popular in the nara period .
in the early heian period , saicho and kukai taught shomyo and became the base of tendai shomyo and shingon shomyo .
in buddhist sects other than the tendai sect and the shingon sect , there is a shomyo of each sect , which is still inherited .
shomyo had not been handed down in kuden .
therefore , the initiation was extremely difficult .
later , hakase ( doctor ) was invented in gakfu .
in addition , each school has different terms of professional terms such as hakase .
however , as hakase was a reference for chanting , it is necessary to learn shomyo ( or roi ) ( called roi ) , it is not a disciple to maintain or maintain the school .
therefore , the training of leaders and successors was required .
with various conditions , many schools disappeared .
tendai shomyo was based on saicho 's teachings and developed his own .
after saicho , ennin and annen were prosperous .
ryonin , the founder of yuzu nenbutsu , is known as the restorer .
in 1109 , ryonin built raigo-in temple ( sakyo ward , kyoto city ) in ohara , kyoto .
the sango ( literally , " mountain name " ) , which is the title prefixed to the name of raiko-in temple in ohara , was referred to as gyozan , the place where shomyo originated in china .
eventually , the two temples of raiko-in temple and shorin-in temple were known as the dojo of ohara-ryu uoyama shomyo .
in addition , jakuren became one of the groups , and there were two groups of shomyo in ohara .
later , muneyoshi restored ohara shomyo .
he established a new style based on the theory of music by tanchi .
since then , he had no center of tendai shomyo and was succeeded to the present tendai shomyo .
the chanting of the yuzu nenbutsu sect , jodo sect and jodo shinshu sect are the lineage of tendai shomyo .
the shingon shomyo is based on kukai 's teachings , and it continues to exist today .
it was after shinga that shomyo was systematized .
kancho can be said to be the restorer among them .
he worked for compositions and maintenance of shomyo .
there were many schools until the kamakura period , but it was summarized in four schools ( honsoin school , shinsooin school , daigo school , and nakagawa daishin school ) .
the shomyo of the kogi shingon sect declined and abolished during the edo period .
the honsooin school , the shinsooin school and the daigo school were abolished until around the middle of the meiji period .
today , the temple is divided into the shingon sect and the kozan sect by shomyo ( chishaku-in temple in kyoto ) , buzan shomyo ( hase-dera temple in nara ) , nanzan shinryu ( shingon sect ) and kozan-ji temple .
chisan shomyo , buzan shomyo ( shomyo of shingi shingon sect ) , chizan school of shingon sect , buzan school of shingon sect , and the shomyo of both schools originated from daishin nakagawa .
yorihiro adopted the old school of daigo .
when negoro-ji temple ( wakayama prefecture ) was burnt down by hideyoshi toyotomi in 1583 , the two schools of chizan and buzan established their own school based on daigo 's old school .
its characteristics are called ' rongi ' and ' shomyo ' of chisan .
the school was based on the nanzan shinryu ( kogi shingon sect line shomyo ) nakagawa daishin school .
nakagawa daishin school was founded by daishin of nakagawa-ji temple in nara .
during the joei era ( 1232 - 1233 ) , shoshin of koyasan rengedani and sanbo-in moved his base to mt . koya .
later , it was also called mt . koya , and it was called minamiyama shinryu .
it is also called shinryu or noyama shinryu .
songs such as heikyoku , yokyoku , minyo , and joruri can be said to be modified .
it greatly influenced melody music .

after that , he did not have an imperial throne for a long time , but after being defeated in the battle of hakusukinoe , he moved the capital to otsu city in 663 .
after the battle of hakusukinoe , mizuki , hobi and sakimori were established as a part of the policy to defend national land .

after the death of shotoku , shirakabe no okimi , the grandson of emperor tenchi , ascended the throne as emperor konin , and after that , it became the tenchi line .
it is said that because prince oama deprived nukata no okimi , he sent four daughters to prince oama as his wife .
brief personal history
626 - birth
on july 12 , 645 , he became the crown prince .
july 24 , 661 - shosei
february 20 , 668 : he ascended the throne .
january 7 , 672 - died at the age of 46 .
( according to " fuso ryakki " ( a brief history of japan ) , there is a theory that the assassination of emperor tenmu was killed by the emperor 's palanquin mount umashina no fukuchi no misasagi . )
it is a mystery of politics in the middle of the seventh century that emperor tenchi did not succeed to the throne for a long time .
there are several theories about this .
consideration for the power to recommend emperor tenmu .
in other words , the emperor tenmu , who had been considered to be a conventional theory , was mistaken that emperor tenchi was a younger brother of emperor tenchi , and the emperor kogyoku was born to his older brother , emperor tenchi .
it is certain that when emperor tenmu was calculated in some historical books of " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) , emperor tenmu became the head of the year .
however , there is no contradiction between the same historical materials , and there are many historical materials that have the age difference between 8 to 9 .
on the other hand , according to the fact that the age of his father was different from his father , ' his younger brother , ' the emperor suizei , ' which meant the death of his father , tenji .
therefore , in 614 , his birth year was adopted by honcho koin jounroku .
against the other hand , the emperor tenchi and jito , who were not unusual in ancient times ( actually , the emperor tenmu and the empress jito , were not enthroned immediately .
this is because there were errors for the reason .
on the other hand , there is an opinion that other historical books , which are pointed out as " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) , were compiled in different periods , and therefore , it is not treated as the same .
( refer to the section of ' emperor tenmu 's age . )
the isshi incident is a coup of prince karu ( emperor kotoku ) , and it is said that naka no oe no oji was expelled from his position .
recently , the relationship between naka no oe no oji and soga no iruka has been relatively good , and it is pointed out that the basic policy is similar .
thus , naka no oe no oji killed iruka .
in addition , this theory came to be recited because the description of the taika reforms in nihonshoki ( chronicles of japan ) was approved .
in addition , in this theory , it is noted that the soga clan other than iruka was not expelled even after the coup d 'etat , such as the reason for abdication of the empress kogyoku .
there is a theory that the enthronement was delayed due to opposition from the relationship between a woman of emperor tenchi .
this is a poem written in " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) that the emperor kotoku , who was described in the " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) , suggested an irregular relationship between her and tenchi .
although her love and marriage were forgiven between her paternal half-brothers , she was not forgiven by her maternal half-brother , but it was a story of satomo 's love .
it is said that after the death of emperor saimei , hashihito no himemiko succeeded to the imperial throne as the wife of the previous emperor , but it is said that some records were cancelled .
in " manyoshu " ( collection of ten thousand leaves ) , the theory that the person who became ' chuko no mikoto ' was a princess , and it is said that ' chuko no mikoto ' was a successor to the enthronement of emperor tenchi .
if hashihito no himemiko ( princess mahito ) is called ' chuokonomikoto , ' it is thought that only she was a special name , but it is not certain that she was emperor saimei .
it is difficult to prove the nature and restrictions of historical materials , but it is difficult to prove the study of the future , including collaboration with archaeological results .
poems
he was also a poet of manyoshu ( collection of ten thousand leaves ) that has four poems .
even in the ogura hyakunin isshu ( the ogura anthology of one hundred tanka-poems by one hundred poets ) , he was respected as the founder of the heian dynasty , and the following poems were included at the beginning .
the rice fields in autumn are inferior to the rubber , and the clothes are not rooted .
it is one of the following poems from manyoshu ( collection of ten thousand leaves ) .
mt . kaguyama competed with unebi and miminashi to fight over the age of the gods , and tried to compete with each other .
the saionji family was a court noble descended from the fujiwara clan .
he was from the kanin line of the northern house of the fujiwara clan , and the family status was seiga family .
the toin family and imadegawa family ( kikutei family ) were separated from the saionji family .
also , the saionji clan , a samurai family in iyo province , was one of the influential branch families who used the surname of saionji .
the family crest is hidari mitsudomoe .
the saionji family was founded by fujiwara no michisue , the third son of fujiwara no kinzane .
when michisue 's great-grandchild , kintsune saionji , married minamoto no yoritomo 's niece as his wife , he was imprisoned by the imperial court as a relative of the kamakura bakufu in the jokyu war .
the family name of saionji originated from the temple built in the villa of kintsune in kyoto ( kitayama-so , kadono-gun , yamashiro province ) .
this hall is also called kitayama-dono , and the current kinkaku-ji temple was built by yoshimitsu ashikaga from the saionji family .
since kintsune , he was supported by the kamakura bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) , and had a power to regain the sekke through the kamakura period .
sanekane saionji approached the daikakuji line and had a daughter to the cloistered emperor kameyama and emperor godaigo .
however , after his son , kinhira saionji , the daikakuji line began to distribute from the bakufu , which led the jimyoin imperial line to deepen the conflict with daikakuji-to .
after that , the kamakura bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) fell and was dismissed from kanto moshitsugi .
kinmune sheltered yasuie hojo ( tokioki ) , the remnants of the hojo clan , and assassinated emperor godaigo , who started the kenmu restoration , and plotted the retired emperor gofushimi of the jimyoin line .
during the period of the northern and southern courts , kinmune 's son sanetoshi saionji served the northern court ( japan ) and restored his family name .
in the muromachi and edo periods , the family was also known as a family business of biwa ( japanese lute ) .
in the early edo period , saneharu saionji adopted tadaoki hosokawa 's legitimate son ( later disinherited ) tadataka hosokawa , and tokuhime , the eldest daughter of kyumu nagaoka , who was a member of the council of the left , as well as yasuyo saionji .
kinmochi saionji was adopted from the tokudaiji family of the kanin line at the end of the edo period , and after the meiji restoration , he was active as a politician and became a genro ( elder statesman ) and a political world in the taisho period .
incidentally , kinmochi had a difficult performance of biwa ( japanese lute ) , the family business of the saionji family , but he was said to have been ' the best biwa officer of the imperial household ' because he was in the office of prime minister .

then , according to the book of the third volume , noinbon 's missing book ' noinbon ' was written in noinbon and ' the pillow book , ' which was written in noin-bon manuscript and the pillow book of sakai-bon .
it is commonly accepted that the name ' makura no soshi ' comes from this place .
according to the " makura no soshi no kenkyu " ( study of makura no soshi ) , he mentioned his own theories , keichu , nobuo origuchi and kikan ikeda .

hizobon theory
theory of unrelated
however , there is no commonly accepted theory .
in addition , ' makura no soshi ' ( the pillow book ) was used as a common noun for the purpose of expressing beautiful colors in " eiga monogatari " ( the tale of flowering fortunes ) .
according to the original document , minamoto no tsunefusa , who was sachu no sho ( middle captain of the left division of inner palace guards ) , brought it from the family of the author , spread to the world .
there is a letter that was written after that , and it seems that it was written around the end of hirohiro .
some of the text of " makura no soshi " ( the pillow book ) , which is written in " genji monogatari shimeisho " ( the tale of genji ) , have complicated process .
the difference between den-bon is large .
it consists of three volumes of zosan .

it is easy to read ' it is easy to read ' and is thought to be the oldest .

yatomi hajimaro kyuzobon , kariya library , kuramoto , date family manuscript , old storehouse , the kajuji family , the former manuscript owned by akika nakahaka , kozando bunko manuscript
it is said that noin hoshi ( one of his sisters was a wife of tachibana no norinaga , the biological son of sei shonagon ) , who was a relative of sei shonagon .
it dates back to the end of the kamakura period .

230 stories except 70 stories at the beginning .
300 stories
it is a collection of sandals .
it is a transcription of the muromachi period .
there is a later record that the copy of the shojibon of doha , a monk living in sakai , was copied by shiken kiyohara .
the second volume .
the diary and memorandum are missing .
gokogon-in manuscript - 190 stories
there is a later record that emperor gokogon copied it .
it is a shinkan-bon .
it is a 95 story book .
the above two types are combined .
in general , sakai-bon refers to this .
it consists of one volume 107 .
it consists of two volumes , 89 stories .
it consists of three volumes and 102 stories .
it consists of four stories and 32 stories .

it is in the box with gold makie box , and it is called " sei shonagon makura no soshi " inlaid of gold .
it is an important cultural property .
it is said to be the oldest manuscript of " makura no soshi " ( the pillow book ) , which was copied in the early kamakura period .
among them , the gokogon-in manuscript of the sakaibon line is included in " gunsho ruiju " and the three categories of sakaibon are included in " new school gunsho ruiju . "
in addition , the noinbon was used as the original text in the old-style katsuji edition in the early edo period ( kanei era ) , and it was a commentary on " makura no soshi shunchu " and " makura no soshi shunsho . "
however , in 1946 , jutaro tanaka ( 1917 - 1987 ) was re-evaluated by jutaro tanaka , and after world war ii , the book was widely used and published .
in addition , " makura no soshi ekotoba " ( picture scrolls of makura no soshi ) , a picture scroll created in the late kamakura period , seems to have been used in the text of kotobagaki .
the third volume 2 of the book has more than 300 independent chapters .
insects include ' the flowers of the trees , ' ' ' sasaji kino ' and ' utsushikimono , ' which are representative of the ' universe , ' and the ' life of the empress . '

it is written in a simple language style using hiragana ( japanese syllabary characters ) , which was written in a simple form of japanese language , and it was a short story of light brush , but it was not included in the fall of the nakanokanpaku family and the empress .
the senso , which was refined and sharp senses of the author , were fond of ' the tale of genji , ' which was a psychological ' world of beauty . '
evaluation
makura no soshi loved human existence and nature , and therefore , in each rank , they were selected and established as a beauty of various colors .
depending on the itosuji , which is repeated from the next to the next , there is no variation of flesh , an imaginary , and a good-looking glob , not good-looking , but also in the sky .
the expression of ' seasons - toki koku ' ( spring and the like ) was a tactic to read traditional japanese poetry , following ' shun-ka-cho ' ( spring - morning ) seen in kokinshu ( collection of ancient and modern japanese poetry ) .
she appears to be adored by chugu sadako .
it was written in order to quiet the soul of sadako , who passed away during the unfortunate misfortunes that michitaka 's family declined .
therefore , it is natural that michitaka 's family was not written ( the same as above ) .
the chapter of praising his praise is also a good-looking figure in the world with the emperor 's gratitude as well as those who were engaged in the recession of chugu and chugu .
critical evaluation
it appears as a light-colored man who forgot the rank of sei shonagon and tried to transform it into upperstream ( shuzan ko ) .
( this is because there is no honorific language for those who have high status , not only their relatives . )
it was not only a record of sadako 's civilization , but was not written by qualification of ' individual ' ( eiji ishida ) .
yoshinobu tokugawa was the fifteenth seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) of the edo bakufu ( japanese feudal government headed by a shogun ) on december 5 , 1866 .
he was the only shogun who did not work as shogun in edo-jo castle .
he was promoted to naidaijin ( minister of the center ) juichii ( junior first rank ) and the first order of merit .
he was a member of the house of peers .
after the death of the 14th shogun iemochi tokugawa , who had served as guardian as shogun , he became the fifteenth shogun of the edo bakufu .
after returning the government to the emperor meiji ( taisei hokan ) , he aimed at the kobu-gattai , but after the restoration of imperial rule , he returned from the former edo-jo castle to osaka-jo castle .
when he was released from house arrest in the meiji period , he died of his hobby and lived as a duke until the taisho period .
yoshinobu ' is also read as ' yoshibu ' or ' keiki ' as a common name .
there is a record that he was read as ' yoshihiasa ' in official documents of the edo bakufu while he was in office of shogun .
his name is also written in the alphabet signat and english-style newspaper by his master .
in mito city , where he was born , he was often called ' yoshibu , ' but in shizuoka city , he is often called ' keiki . '
according to the people who know yoshinobu in his life , yoshinobu liked to call him ' keiki-sama , ' and he also called himself ' keiki-sama , ' which was his younger brother , akitake tokugawa .
it is said that yoshihisa tokugawa , who succeeded yoshinobu , was also called ' keikyu-sama ' by people around the same time as yoshinobu .
the two names of ' keiki-sama ' and ' keiki-san ' can be confirmed , and even today , it is thought that the term ' keiki-san ' can be used only in shizuoka .
ryotaro shiba said that many people called " keiki " were related to the former retainers of the tokugawa shogunate , but they were preferred by those who were involved in overthrowing the shogunate .
he was born on september 29 , 1837 as the seventh son of nariaki tokugawa , the ninth lord of the mito domain in koishikawa , edo .
his mother was the shogun who gave birth to his lawful wife , princess yoshiko ( the third shogun , iemitsu tokugawa ) .
however , it is said that iemitsu 's real mother was oe no kata , the lawful wife of hidetada , who was the real mother of kasuga no tsubone .
his childhood name was shichiromaro .
in accordance with the education policy of nariaki , ' men moved to the mito domain for seven months after his birth , and they met many martial arts , including shosai ichihashi , who was a teacher of martial arts .
it seems that yoshinobu had been attracted from the time , and at first , nariaki was not adopted into other families , and he thought that his eldest son ( legitimate son ) yoshiatsu tokugawa 's condition .
on august 1 , 1847 , the bakufu ordered shichiromaro to be the heir of the gosankyo hitotsubashi family to the mito domain .
in response to this , shichiromaro succeeded to the hitotsubashi family on september 1 , and in december , he was granted the name of yoshinobu by the 12th shogun ieyoshi tokugawa .
ieyoshi often visited the hitotsubashi residence as a candidate for yoshinobu as the successor , but he refused the request by masahiro abe , roju ( member of shogun 's council of elders ) .
in 1853 , shogun ieyoshi died of illness during the confusion of the arrival of the kurofune , and the 13th shogun iesada tokugawa , who succeeded him , had no heir .
it was the first confrontation between nariaki , masahiro abe , masahiro abe , the lord of satsuma domain , nariakira shimazu , and naosuke ii , the lord of the kishu domain , and iesada 's real mother honjuin .
the hitotsubashi school tried to support tenshoin , an adopted daughter of nariakira shimazu , to o-oku as shogun and midaidokoro , but in 1858 , masahiro abe and nariakira shimazu passed away .
in the same year , naosuke ii signed the treaty of amity and commerce between the united states and japan .
yoshinobu went up to the castle with nariaki and yoshinaga matsudaira , the lord of the fukui domain , and questioned naosuke , however , he was imprisoned and confined in 1859 .
in addition , yoshinobu himself did not get on the condition that he would become the heir of the shogun or said , ' he did not send a letter to nariaki , but he did not send it to nariaki . '
in 1860 , his house arrest was removed .
in 1862 , an imperial envoy shigetomi ohara , who was defended by hisamitsu shimazu 's army , entered edo , and the imperial edict ' yoshinobu tokugawa was appointed as a guardian and appointed to shogun , shungaku matsudaira . '
on july 6 , the bakufu appointed yoshinobu as shogun and shungaku as seiji sosai .
yoshinobu and shungaku reformed the shogunate government called the bunkyu reforms , and established kyoto shugoshoku ( military governor of kyoto ) and reluctant to sankin-kotai .
in 1863 , he went up to kyoto as a pioneer of shogun iemochi tokugawa to negotiate with the imperial court who urged foreigners .
when the emperor komei visited iwashimizu hachiman-gu shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners , iemochi was forced to have an audience with him , and he hurriedly received an audience with him .
when the sonno joi ha ( supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expulsion of foreigners ) , centered on the choshu clan , was forced to participate in the council of sanyo by the kobu-gattai and the sabaku faction .
however , if the conference was not satisfied , he asked sojo date , shungaku matsudaira , and hisamitsu shimazu , who had been in a drinking party with imperial prince kuninomiya asahiko , and so on .
after that , he stayed in kyoto and was appointed as kinri goshuei sotoku ( the governor-general of the imperial palace ) , and was appointed as shugoshoku ( the lord of aizu domain ) katamori matsudaira , shoshidai ( the lord of kuwana domain ) and a court noble .
in the tenguto war , kounsai takeda , who supported yoshinobu , cut off the vassals of the mito domain .
in 1864 , in the kinmon incident , he commanded the bakufu army and occupied the takatsukasa residence and attacked the choshu army .
after the first conquest of choshu continued , he ran away to the imperial sanction of the treaty of amity between japan and the united states , which was in the absence of imperial sanction , and succeeded in obtaining imperial sanction .
in the second conquest of choshu in 1866 , yoshinobu received an imperial order to suppress the satsuma domain .
however , the satsuma clan refused to dispatch troops to satsuma , which formed the satsuma-choshu alliance , and the bakufu army was defeated .
on july 20 , during the second conquest of choshu , shogun iemochi died in osaka-jo castle .
yoshinobu raised an imperial rescript to the imperial court and succeeded in the conclusion of the resurrection agreement .
although he was recommended as iemochi 's successor , yoshinobu firmly declined .
on august 20 , the tokugawa shogunate family inherited the position of shogun , but he refused to take the position of shogun .
after that , roju and others asked him to become shogun , but on december 5 , he was given the title of shogun by the emperor komei .
this was because he became a shogun in the form of selling oneself , and he aimed to proceed the politics with advantage .
yoshinobu established the yokosuka iron factory , zozo shusensho ( shipbuilding office ) and shunesho ( shipbuilding office ) , and started military reforms through the french minister leon rosh .
he also encouraged his younger brother european studies , such as dispatching akitake tokugawa to the paris world exposition .
in the issue of the opening of hyogo port , he persuaded the imperial court to obtain the imperial sanction .

he was born in the highest environment to learn military arts and learning , and he was enthusiastic in shuriken ( hand-hand swordplay ) and was a master of shuriken ( shuriken ) .
even after taisei hokan ( transfer of power back to the emperor ) , he practiced shuriken swordplay on the forehead of the mainichi day , and is counted as the most famous person among the masters of shuriken .
when his father nariaki tokugawa became a problem when he was a successor of the tokugawa family , he was so disappointed that he couldn 't take the tonsure in his bed .
on the other hand , there is an anecdote that when he was young , he was confronted with three people like two wives and concubines as a countermeasure against the assassination .
yoshinobu is said to have been a photograph in his childhood , but it is doubtful that yoshinobu 's photograph was not found in japan during yoshinobu 's childhood .
it is said that he visited iemochi , who fell ill , and he usually saw him .
he was known for his eulogy and his real father nariaki tokugawa 's beloved sword , tatewaki anjima , praised yoshinobu as ' the flow of the tokugawa clan , ' and he was expected to take care of ieyasu tokugawa .
yoshinobu 's eimei was also informed of the anti-shogunate faction , and in particular , takayoshi kido of the choshu domain was in particular , ' yoshinobu hitotsubashi 's boldness .
he was watching ieyasu 's future . '
ryoma sakamoto inspired that ' oju ( shogun ) ( shogun ) , kin ( shogun ) , and today 's feelings are not realized to decide taisei hokan ( transfer of power back to the emperor ) .
even if you don 't give it well , you should not get anything .
in advance , he made a pledge to abandon his life for the public and tried to give yoshinobu the position of vice kanpaku of the new government .
however , yoshinobu 's honjin knew the existence of ryoma ( after the death of ryoma ) .
it was not only a story that yoshinobu was not limited to yoshinobu , but the reputation of ryoma in his life was very low compared to that after the meiji restoration .
he was defeated in the battle of toba-fushimi and fled back to edo , and was greatly criticized by the enemy 's side .
at that time , the umajirushi of the kinsen had forgotten since ieyasu , but there were some people who were in charge of having accompanied yoshinobu 's favorite concubine without forgotten .
however , at this time , it was necessary to defend osaka-jo castle because there was a need to protest against armed uprisings in edo and musashi provinces and yoshinobu had to fight for a long time .
it is said that his master was from the imperial family and his mother was from the imperial family , because he was considered to be an enemy of the new government or confinement of kanei-ji temple .
it is said that the modern japan was highly evaluated because the japanese independence of modern japan could have been transferred to the state of bloodless revolution due to allegiance and the surrender of edo without blood .
eichi shibusawa , a businessman , was a retainer who was appointed as the head of the hitotsubashi-tokugawa family , and had a close relationship with the meiji restoration .
in yoshinobu 's later years , shibusawa , aiming to compile yoshinobu 's denki ( a record of yoshinobu 's biography ) , proposed yoshinobu 's confession and opened a ' old dream party . '
" kojimukai hikki " ( a record of the old dreams ) was compiled .
in some chapters which are recorded in the form of theatrical meetings , the old yoshinobu can be seen .
as a result of his age , he was afraid of the poor questions of the capital , ' hisamitsu shimazu was so fond of that time , ' naomasa nabeshima 's personality was ready . '
" tokugawa yoshinobu koden " was completed based on such materials .
yoshinobu forgiven himself as an emperor 's enemy , and as he showed his gratitude to emperor meiji who was the highest rank of the peerage , yoshinobu did not have a funeral .
therefore , yoshinobu 's grave was not the graveyard of the zojo-ji tokugawa family , the family temple of the tokugawa family , but also a round barrow similar to that of the imperial family was built in yanaka cemetery .
this is because the imperial mausoleum of emperor komei was impressed by the fact that it was a simplicity ( " keisen yoshinobu koden " ) .
yoshinobu , who was after pardon , did not want to give his life to the former shogun 's retainers who had dedicated his life to yoshinobu , and sent him to ' roju ' in those days .
he had a weak image in the battle of toba-fushimi , such as ' enemies ' in the battle of toba-fushimi , but in recent years , he made a new modern political reform after taisei hokan .
like his father nariaki , pork was favored by the satsuma clan , and was called " batai-sama " or " pork hitotsubashi-sama . "
in addition , he was interested in western literary products , and in his later years , he liked breads and milk , and he learned photographs , airplanes , kenbi-kyo ( embroidery ) and keishu ( embroidery ) .
although it is famous as a cameraman , it seems that the technique of camera studio was not successful .
he often contributed to photograph magazines , but it is said that he was not adopted .
his great-grandchild , yoshitomo tokugawa , was also a cameraman , and a photograph possessed by yoshinobu tokugawa was found and published in the collection .
akitake tokugawa , his younger brother , was a friend of such hobby lifestyle .
on december 3 , 1858 , he married mitsuko ichijo ( he changed his name to mitsuko after the meiji restoration ) .
she was born on july 16 , 1858 with mika , her eldest daughter ( also known as keikoinden ikekage no odo ) , but she died young on july 20 .
since then , the 10th and 11 daughters born in the meiji period were sons and children with two concubines .
he was a prince and the ninth daughter tsuneko , the seventh son yoshihisa , who succeeded yoshinobu tokugawa , and the adopted son-in-law of kaishu katsu , and the wife of fushiminomiya hiroyasu .

the entire line is included in the large urban area .
because it has a history as a branch line of the kansai main line , the official starting point is kizu station , but inbound trains go from kyoto to kizu ( the number of trains is odd ) , and this is the same as that of this train .
except for the following data , it will be described in the direction from kyoto to kizu .
the line color is brown , and the reason for selection is said to be ' the image of a crucifix that connects the two ancient capitals . '

the line between kyoto and kizu is named the nara line , but the entire section is located in kyoto prefecture and there is no route in nara prefecture .
although this was initially constructed by nara railway , the line between kyoto and nara was separated from kizu as a part of the osaka - nagoya route after the merger of kansai railway .
however , the trains run from kizu station to kansai main line ( yamatoji line ) to nara station in nara prefecture .
jr west established a nickname for each line ( jr kyoto line and jr kobe line ) on march 13 , 1988 due to the revision of the urban network , but they were sent to the nara line .
since the kintetsu nara line also has the kintetsu nara line , it is sometimes called the ' jr nara line . '
during the period of japan national railways , it was guided as the ' jnr nara line , ' and the english letter ' jnr ' was added .
the kintetsu nara line is a rival of the yamatoji line between nanba and nara , and the jr nara line is the kintetsu kyoto line .
while the keihan uji line and the kintetsu kyoto line operated in parallel with the keihan uji line and the kintetsu kyoto line , the nara line had been electrified only by the jnr / jr suburban trains until 1984 .
however , after the inauguration of jr west , the trains were integrated into the urban network , and some of the rapid trains began to be extended to four-car trains , such as ' rapid trains ' and rapid trains .

in mid-august , the uji-gawa river fireworks display , which is the nearest station of uji station , is operated only between 16 : 00 and 16 : 00 , because the transportation capacity isn 't secured .

also , along national route 24 and kohata station ( near obaku station ) on the keihan uji line along the national route 24 between jr fujinomori station and momoyama station , it is difficult to acquire land .
due to the shortage of budget , the sagano line ( the sanin main line kyoto station - sonobe section ) was promoted to a double-track section at the lowest point .

keiji bypass ( keiji bypass and keiji ) is a bypass of the general national route from kusatsu city , shiga prefecture to kumiyama-cho , kuse-gun , kyoto prefecture .
it is designated as a plan for regional highways .
the following is about the keiji bypass of the toll road , and the keiji bypass on national route 1 and 24 are described below .
it is integrated with the meishin expressway , and connects the ritto interchange , nagoya city , and the suita interchange of meijin across the urban area of otsu city and kyoto city .
according to the law , the setahigashi interchange - kumiyama-yodo interchange is a national highway route no. 1 and 478 by the national highway route ( keiji bypass ) and the kyoto prefectural road no. 478 , which is designated as the national highway route .
as a result of the later plan , the kyoto bypass was the second bypass , because the traffic congestion between meishin expressway and the radio and loop line of kyoto city , it was the need for road construction .
the kyoto longitudinal expressway and the kyoto second outer loop expressway are designated as national route 478 and has been maintained .
according to the route indications , the road is easy to understand the user , and it is said that keiji bypass is operated in seta higashi jct - oyamazaki jct .
there is no difference between meishin expressway and keiji bypass via both .
here , when there is no special mention , keiji bypass ( from seta higashi interchange to oyamazaki jct ) as the name of the business line is described .
origin : seta oe-cho , otsu city , shiga prefecture

the uji tunnel on this line is the longest of national route 1 , 313 meters , and the tunnel is prohibited to change the lanes except for ujihigashi interchange and kasatori interchange-mae 500 meters .
before the opening of the kumiyama junction , film " odori odori avie2 leever " was shot .
the distance between setahigashi interchange and oyamazaki interchange is slightly shorter than the meishin expressway , and when the keiji bypass runs through the maximum speed .
in addition , because there is no rest area such as the service area , the meishin expressway is often crowded ( the rest area between seta-higashi station and oyamazaki rest area of meishin expressway is located in otsu rest area and katsura-gawa river .
however , the structure of seta-higashi and oyamazaki-ryo jct was established after the meijin ( especially , the construction of oyamazaki jct is extremely complicated ) , which is a lowest expressway .
there is an indispensable point to congestion with the left route of meishin expressway in order to go from oyamazaki jct to suita and osaka .
on the way , the curves and slopes have been continuously connected , so the road has not been sufficient as a bypass of the meishin expressway because there are little drivelines to respect these .
this road is a bypass of national route 1 ( general national route ) and is not a expressway but a expressway .
when keiji bypass from the east side of the uji-gawa river to the uji-nishi interchange in the direction of suita and osaka .
this is because the ujihigashi interchange is hafu ic .
therefore , the general road section between ujihigashi interchange and uji-nishi interchange is often congested during the commuting hours .
the general road section is not suitable for the v-range section , so it is difficult to prevent traffic congestion .

amaterasu omikami ( also known as amaterasu omikami ) is a god ( shinto ) appearing in japanese mythology .
in " engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , ' amaterasu ' is referred to as ' amateureru . '
it is a god that deified the sun and is regarded as one of the soshin ( ancestor gods ) of the imperial family .
in " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) , it is written as 天照大御神 or 天照大神 in " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) .
it is also known as ohirume no muchi no kami .
in the " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) , there are several shinmei , but in " kojiki , " it is unified as ' amaterasu omikami . '
although she is a goddess , there is a different opinion that she was a male god .
because the name of amaterasu omikami is used in political parts such as " kota jingu gishikicho " ( a register of ceremonies of kotai jingu shrine ) , the ancestor of takamimusubi is also a descendant of takamimusubi .
in ise-jingu shrine , amaterasu omikami is usually called amateurasu okami or sumemikamikoto at the time of worship .
today , in academic documents , ' amaterasu ' and katakana-gaki are common .
there is a theory that it was written as 天照太神 in ancient times .
descriptions in mythology
in " kojiki " ( the records of ancient matters ) , izanagi wrote that he was born from the yomi where izanami lived and washed the left eye when he washing the impurity of yominokuni .
at that time , she was called mikishi along with tsukuyomi , born from the right eye and susano , who was born from nose .
at this time , izanagi ordered amaterasu omikami to rule takamanohara .
susanoo , who was commissioned by kaibara , was exiled by izanagi because he kept crying in nenokuni , where izanami had lived .
susanoo went to takamanohara to see her elder sister amaterasu omikami before going to nenokuni , but amaterasu omikami thought that amaterasu omikami had taken takamagahara .
susano made a pledge to prove the purity of susanoo , and the three goddesses were born from the monozane of amaterasu omikami and susanoo , and susanoo won the war .
the following five gods were born from the fact that amaterasu omikami was born .
amenooshihomimi
amenohohi
amatsuhikone
kushihikone
kumanokusubi
susano , who realized this , committed violent acts in takamanohara , and amaterasu omikami was hidden in ama no iwato .
the world became dark and various misfortune occurred .
( yagoroikane no mikoto , the god of chie no kami , and amenookoyane no mikoto , who were the gods of heaven , were successful from amaterasu omikami and amaterasu omikami .
he dispatched amenotsugami to order his son amenooshihomimi to ashihara no nakatsukuni .
ashihara no nakatsukuni was conquered , and amenooshihomimi came to rule the country , but ninigi was born during that time , and he ordered his grandson ninigi to descend .
interpretation
in mythologies , there is a scene where amaterasu omikami is worshipped as a god because it can be seen in the view of the wrongs of amatsukami ( takamimusubi ) , who was born earlier than him .
there is also a view that it is a deification of a shrine maiden in ancient times .
another name ' hirume ' is ' a woman of the sun , ' and it refers to a shrine maiden serving the sun god .
although the sun god was originally a male god , there is a theory that a miko who served him was identified with the sun god and became a goddess .
in addition , there is a theory that this goddess was established around the time of empress jito , and it is said that himiko was the model of amaterasu omikami today .
the birth of the ' me ' of the sun and the moon of amaterasu omikami and tsukuyomi is said to have been " reiho gofujo " ( literally , five treasures of the taoism ) by taoism ( before the sixth century ) .
in addition , there are two types : ise-jingu shrine , jingu shrine , itsuki-no-miya shrine , itsuki-no-yakata shrine , itsuki-no-yakata-jingu shrine , murasakino mikoto-no-mikoto , and itsuho .
in comparison , it is pointed out that the myth of birth of amaterasu omikami is almost identical with the banko myth , which is recorded in the older period ( third to fourth century ) .
in addition , it is also a myth that regards both eye as a day and month , because it was universal energy that spread throughout asia , it was introduced into japan along with the ethnic transmission of the previous history .
according to " nihonshoki " ( chronicles of japan ) , there is a theory that the divinity changed into three stages .
the following are the incidents and contents of the incident .
645 : the taika reforms
before this , the imperial family does not enshrine amaterasu omikami .
hi no kami ' ( the sun god ) , ' the sun itself '
a male god called ' amateru ' was widely enshrined .
in the " engishiki " ( an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers ) , the ' amaitome-jinja shrine ' in tsushima and ' amatsumitama-jinja shrine ' in harima .
incidentally , the male god amaterasu is another name for amenohoakari , a grandson of amaterasu , and the founder of the owari clan , the tsumori clan and the kaibe clan .
also , the younger brother of amenohoakari was ninigi and the great-grandfather of emperor jinmu .
672 : jinshin war
dainichimenomuchi : ' a woman with the sun god ' and ' tanabatatsume . '
in this case , there is a interpretation that the enshrined deity is dainichinyi , and it is interpreted as ' amhereru , ' a male god of snake .
698 : kotai-jingu shrine was founded .
amaterasu ' and ' ancestor of the imperial family '
she is a goddess .
it was created by nature gods modeled after empress jito .
after that , ' amaterasu ' other than koso-shin was called ' amateru . '
for example , in " sarashina nikki " ( around 1060 ) , the part of ' amaterasu ' is read as ' amaterasu omikami ' and it is also called ' amaterasu ' in " sendai kujihongi . "
in 1880 - 1881 , there was a dispute over the enshrined deity of shinto jimukyoku , which was set up in hibiya , tokyo .
shinto jimukyoku , in addition to the enshrined deities of the jimukyoku , the three gods of creation ( amenominakanushi no kami , takamimusubi no kami , and amaterasu omikami ) , were enshrined in the four major shrines .
however , the ' ise school , ' which played the central role of shinto jimukyoku , was ' heaven and earth , ' which ruled kenyu ryokai , and the other gods were not directly opposed to each other .
in the end , there were various theories such as ' the izumo school tried to harsh the resentment of the age of gods , ' and ' senke sonpuku , who was in the imperial family , ' and others were killed .
before long , this dispute was settled by emperor meiji 's judgment ( izumo school was defeated ) , and amaterasu omikami was ranked the highest rank .
it is said that the government recognized the possibility of creating the creed system common to shinto and the modern state could directly control the people by the restoration shinto theory .
refer to the dispute on the enshrined deity of state shinto jimukyoku .
ryunosuke akutagawa used another name ' dainichimuchi ' when amaterasu omikami appears in his novel .
this is because the name ' amaterasu omikami ' does not appear in the sentences , so the sun god does not use ' dainichi ' because it is a god of nature .
in fact , there are many novels of akutagawa that had no choice but to correct , handwriting , and scrape .
masaatsu yasuoka ( 1898 - 1983 ) , who established kinkei gakuin , is a belief of amaterasu omikami in japan .
amaterasu omikami is the ideal of bringing the world with the japanese spirit .
in other words , it is considered that izanami and izanagi 's ' izanami ' is the ideology of the world ethnic , pioneer , and guidance . '
shrines that enshrine amaterasu omikami
shrines that enshrine amaterasu omikami are called shinmei-jinja shrine , and all of them are naiku ( kotai-jingu shrine ) of jingu ( ise-jingu shrine ) .
kotai-jingu shrine enshrines yata no kagami ( the mirror of yata no kagami ) , one of the three sacred treasures of the imperial family , as the object of worship .
most shrines across japan are distributed to the kamifuda ( jingu taima ) of kotai-jingu shrine ( amaterasu omikami-gu shrine ) .
